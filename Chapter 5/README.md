# Chapter 5

This chapter of the book focused on the most basic program which is made in graphics programming

It is the famous triangle program. Also known as the "Hello World" of graphics.

The complexity and the sheer amount of boilerplate setup that is required for this program to work often deters people from starting to attempt to learn.

To write this program you must have very basic knowledge of:

- Window management API (WinAPI, SDL, GLFW ect)
- Setup OpenGL (GLAD)
- Vertex Buffers
- The OpenGL NDC (Normalised Device Co-ordinates)
- Vertex Buffer Objects
- Vertex Shaders
- Fragment Shaders
- Draw calls
