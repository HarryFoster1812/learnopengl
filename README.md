# LearnOpenGL Exercises

This repository contains my implementation of all the exercises from [LearnOpenGL.com](https://learnopengl.com/), a great resource for learning modern OpenGL with C++.

##  About

The goal of this project is to build a strong understanding of OpenGL by working through all of the tutorials and exercises provided on LearnOpenGL. Each section corresponds to a chapter or concept, with source code that demonstrates the key ideas in action.

## Features

- OpenGL 3.3 Core Profile
- GLFW for window/context/input management
- GLAD for loading OpenGL functions
- Exercises organized by tutorial section
- Shader-based rendering (modern OpenGL)
- Clean, well-commented code

## Dependencies

To build and run the examples, you will need:

- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/)
- [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/)
- [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) (optional, for math-heavy tutorials)
- A C++17-compatible compiler
- CMake (recommended for multi-platform builds)
